# pr-bot
Pull request merger bot from emails.

Designed to overcome Etiya's continuous merge requests from QA Engineers.

## Why mail ?

 - Bitbucket had no web hook about that
 - No socket or pull strategy available for changes for clients

Then mail used as a **pub/sub** pattern to know changes


##

No longer needed + maintained. 

## 

If it has a pattern, recognize and automate it !
